                <h2> FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
                    <h3 class = "questions"><b>Who can apply?</b></h3>
                         <p class = "answers">Scholarships are available for high school students applying to 4-year or 2-year colleges.</p>  
                    <h3 class = "questions"><b>Should I still apply if I don't meet all the criteria?</b></h3>
                         <p class = "answers"><b>No.</b> Don't apply if you don't meet the criteria exactly. Scholarship providers typically receive thousands of 
                         applications so anyone who doesn't meet all the requirements is typically disqualified.</p>
                    <h3 class = "questions"><b>How does the scholarship provider choose a winner?</b></h3>
                         <p class = "answers">Each scholarship provider is looking for different skills or interests. Use what the scholarship provider is looking
                         for to distinguish yourself from the rest of the applicants. A winner must meet all of the standard criteria required for the scholarship.</p>
                    <h3 class = "questions"><b>Does the amount I receive in scholarships affect my eligibility for financial aid?</b></h3>
                         <p class = "answers"><b>Yes.</b> Often the scholarship provider gives your award to the college you are attending as credit towards your tuition
                         and your financial aid is adjusted accordingly.</p>
                    <h3 class = "questions"><b>How quickly will I be notified?</b></h3>
                         <p class = "answers">You will typically be notified a few weeks after the deadline. However, this varies with each scholarship provider.</p>
                    <h3 class = "questions"><b>Who should I ask to write my letter of recommendation?</b></h3>
                         <p class = "answers">Start by asking a teacher, employer or mentor. Do not ask a friend or family member. Choose someone who can articulate
                         your strengths and praise your accomplishments.</p>
                    <h3 class = "questions"><b>How does community service increase my chances for receiving a scholarship?</b></h3>
                         <p class = "answers">Community service is a common essay topic and can distinguish you from other applicants. Being involved in community services
                         shows scholarship providers that you are someone who gives back to your community by making contributions of time and service.</p>
                    <h3 class = "questions"><b>What is the difference between a merit scholarship and a lottery scholarship?</b></h3>
                         <p class = "answers">Merit scholarships distinguish students by academic excellence, participation in extracurricular activities and involvement
                         in community service. Lottery scholarships, on the other hand, are chosen at random and every student who applies has an equal chance of winning</p>
